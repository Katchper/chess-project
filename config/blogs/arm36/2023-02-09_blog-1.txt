Action 2: One or two people to read SE.QA.04 and start working on UI specification
by making a list of possible use cases based on the requirements document,
and to report back to the group next week.

I read the requirements document thoroughly and made notes that can be shared with other team members if need be, 
and made a good start on the use case document, listing a few possible use cases,

Hours: 4

Action 3: Start thinking about who should be project leader and quality assurance manager and their deputies. Discuss next week.
